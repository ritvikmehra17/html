Birds, also known as Aves, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, 
the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. 
Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the world's most numerically-successful class of tetrapods, 
with approximately ten thousand living species, more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds have wings which are more or 
less developed depending on the species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, 
gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in flightless birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species of birds.
 The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, 
have further evolved for swimming.<br><br></p>

Reverse genetic engineering[3] and the fossil record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, 
having evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs. 
The closest living relatives of birds are the crocodilians. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, 
have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago.[1] Many of these early "stem-birds", such as Archaeopteryx, 
were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.<br><br></p>

DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off 
the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages. But birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other 
parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling.[4] This makes them the sole surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics.<br><br></p>

<h2>Three Different Types Of Birds</h2>
<ol type="I">
  <li><h3>AVOCET</h3>
<img src="d4.jpg" title="Avocet" width="104" height="142">
<br>
<p style="color:yellow"><i><b>
There are four different species of Avocet found around the world - Pied Avocet, 
Red-necked Avocet, Andean Avocet, and American Avocet. <br>
This bird is found in North and South America, Europe, and even Australia.<br> 
This long-legged bird has webbed feet and an upturned, thin bill.<br>
They live in large colonies and have been known to become quite aggressive and defensive,<br> 
if feel threatened.
</p></i></b>
<br>

<li><h3>BLAD EAGLE</h3>
<img src="d5.jpg"title="Blad Eagle" width="104" height="142">
<br>
<p style="color:orange"><i><b>
The bald eagle is found in marshes and near coastlines. <br>
They have very large and broad wings, with a broad tail. <br>
The head and tail are white in color, which is the major distinguishable <br>
factor of the bald eagle. The long, hooked bill is yellow in color. <br>
They prey on fish, ducks, rabbits, raccoons, beavers, geese, gulls, reptiles, etc..
</p></i></b>
<br>

<li><h3>CATBIRDS</h3>
<img src="d6.jpg"title="Catbirds" width="104" height="142">
<br>
<p style="color:red"><i><b>

Catbirds are known to imitate the sounds of other birds.<br>
They are gray in color, and have a shade of chestnut, just under their tail.<br>
 Different species of catbirds are found in various parts of the world - Spotted catbird,<br> 
Green catbird, White-eared catbird, Tooth-billed catbird, Gray catbird, Black catbird, <br>
and Abyssinian catbird.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Here is a <sub>poem</sub> on <sup>birds</sup> </h2>
<pre style="text-align:center;">
Lying in my hammock, I'm looking at the sky.
No matter what goes on down here, the birds go sailing by.
They don't pay me attention, for I am no concern.
I feel if I watch long enough, there's so much I could learn.

What is it that they're showing me that I have yet to see? 
They fly and soar without a care, just happy to be free.
I guess I'm very lucky to be living as I do.
I have nothing that I yearn for and my bills arn't overdue.


I'll just lie here in my hammock on my front porch in the shade.
I'll thank the birds for showing me that I've really got it made! !
