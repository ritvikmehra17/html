Reverse genetic engineering and the fossil record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, 
having evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs. 
The closest living relatives of birds are the crocodilians. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, 
have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago.[1] Many of these early "stem-birds", such as Archaeopteryx, 
were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.

Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.
They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.
Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, 
and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. 
Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish 
as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding 
the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all 
descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term 
"fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a
 formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the 
cladistic sense, including tetrapods.[1][2] The traditional term pisces 
(also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic 
classification.

	The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied 
chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they 
lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more 
agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve 
through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms.
Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them 
from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, 
after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather 
than just the prey of arthropods.</div></p>

Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), 
allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, 
though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a 
higher core temperature.[3][4]

Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of 
acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the 
transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. 
The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often 
used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.[5] 
The sounds emitted by fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus 
involved. They can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components 
of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating 
specialized organs such as the swimbladder.[6]

Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all 
aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) 
to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and 
anglerfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of
the ocean. With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity
than any other group of vertebrates.[7][8]

Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. 
Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) 
or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). 
They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by 
fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have had a role in culture 
through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects 
of art, books and movies.
